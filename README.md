# Wolf:MP mod for Enemy Territory Quake Wars
Wolf:MP is a mod for the game Enemy Territory : Quake Wars released (ETQW) which was released in 2007.
After the disappointing Wolfenstein game in 2009, and the really good but SP only Wolfenstein : The New Order / The Old Blood, we (old Wolfenstein : Enemy Territory players) felt the need for a proper Wolfenstein multiplayer game. That's why Wolf:MP exists. 
It plans on getting the best of both games Wolfenstein:Enemy Territory and ETQW into a single package.
